/** @class TrainingAlgorithm
 *  @brief Base class for LBANN training_algorithms.
 *
 *  A "training algorithm" is defined as a method for modifying one or
 *  more models, where "model" is defined in the LBANN sense (that is,
 *  a model object typically consists of a machine learning model plus
 *  a "sub-DAG" for computing a training-specific objective
 *  function). At this time, we only have support for training a
 *  single model unit, though some ad hoc methods exist for training
 *  multi-model scenarios such as GANs.
 *
 *  Logically, the inputs to a training algorithm are a model
 *  architecture (encapsulated in a model object) and a data source,
 *  and the output is a trained model (or, a set of parameters that
 *  define the action of the model). Here, "trained" means that the
 *  training algorithm has evolved the parameters until user-specified
 *  stopping criteria have been met; it does necessarily imply that
 *  any underlying optimization method has converged (or even exists)
 *  or that such a convergence is even well-defined.
 *
 *  A key capability is that training algorithms should be
 *  composable. This allows metaheuristic algorithms to simply be
 *  implemented as training algorithms constructed from one or more
 *  "inner" training algorithms.
 *
 *  @todo One component that we need to address yet is the issue of
 *        logically encapsulating multiple models, as either inputs or
 *        outputs to a training algorithm. Specifically, consider the
 *        LTFB "meta-learning" method. Rather than producing the
 *        single best model, a user might be interested in the K best
 *        models. In this case, tournament-based evolution will begin
 *        with a single model (per trainer) but could output several
 *        models. Similarly, one might begin with an arbitrary
 *        collection of models that are evolved until a single best
 *        model emerges. This draws in other issues to be addressed
 *        elsewhere in LBANN such as "How do we export models?"
 *        Currently, this is done by writing to files on disk via
 *        callbacks. However, one might imagine "in-core" interaction
 *        between training and inference, perhaps in an online
 *        learning scenario, in which repeatedly writing to and
 *        reading from disk is not sufficient.
